## Combat System Status & Attack Detection Fixes (Latest Update)

### **Current Combat System State**
- ✅ **Player Attack System**: Fully functional with improved detection
- ✅ **Zombie Physics**: Stabilized with comprehensive physics protection
- ✅ **Damage Application**: Working correctly for both player and zombies
- ✅ **Animation System**: Attack montages playing properly
- ✅ **Damage Numbers**: Spawning correctly above targets

### **Attack Detection Improvements Applied**
**Problem Solved**: Initial hit worked perfectly, but subsequent hits weren't registering consistently.

**Root Cause**: Attack detection was too restrictive and relied on single detection method.

**Solution Implemented**: Multi-layered attack detection system with backup methods:

#### **Enhanced OnMeleeAttackNotify Function**:
1. **Duplicate Call Prevention**: Added `bAttackNotifyInProgress` flag to prevent multiple calls
2. **Multi-Method Detection**:
   - **Method 1**: Direct sphere overlap at player location (most reliable)
   - **Method 2**: Forward sweep as backup if no hits found
3. **Improved Hit Validation**:
   - Class name detection: `HitActor->GetClass()->GetName().Contains(TEXT("ZombieCharacter"))`
   - More lenient distance and direction checks
   - Dot product threshold: `-0.5f` (allows wider attack angles)
4. **Hit Tracking**: `TSet<AActor*> AlreadyHitActors` prevents multiple hits per attack
5. **Enhanced Damage Calculation**: Base damage + weapon damage from equipped items

#### **Attack Parameters**:
- **Attack Range**: 300.0f (reasonable melee range)
- **Attack Radius**: 200.0f (larger for better detection)
- **Detection Methods**: Sphere overlap + forward sweep backup
- **Direction Tolerance**: Dot product > -0.5f (allows side attacks)

#### **Backup Timer System**:
- Added backup timer at 60% through animation to ensure damage application
- Prevents issues if animation notify isn't properly set up
- Timer calls `OnMeleeAttackNotify` automatically

### **Zombie Physics Protection System**
**Comprehensive multi-layer protection against flying zombies**:

#### **Constructor Level**:
- Disabled physics simulation on capsule and mesh
- Disabled gravity on capsule
- Set collision responses properly

#### **BeginPlay Hardening**:
- **Mass**: 1000kg (very heavy to resist impulses)
- **Damping**: Linear 10.0f, Angular 10.0f
- **CCD**: Disabled to prevent physics glitches
- **Movement**: High friction (20.0f), high braking (4096.0f)

#### **TakeDamage Safety Protocol**:
- Location stored before damage processing
- Physics state re-enforced on each hit
- Velocity reset to zero immediately
- Location reset with `ETeleportType::ResetPhysics`
- Movement mode locked to walking

### **Combat Flow Verification**
**Confirmed working sequence**:
1. Player presses attack → `MeleeAttack()` called
2. Animation montage plays → backup timer set
3. At 60% animation → `OnMeleeAttackNotify()` called
4. Multi-method detection finds zombies
5. Damage applied → zombie takes damage correctly
6. Damage numbers spawn above zombie
7. Zombie stays grounded (no flying)
8. Attack cooldown resets → ready for next attack

### **Key Technical Details**
- **Attack Cooldown**: 1.0f seconds
- **Damage Calculation**: `BaseDamage + WeaponDamage`
- **Detection Priority**: Sphere overlap → Forward sweep → None found
- **Physics Reset**: Every damage event for maximum stability
- **Team System**: Player team ID 1, Zombie team ID 2

### **Files Modified**
- `Source/AtlantisEons/AtlantisEonsCharacter.cpp`: Enhanced attack detection
- `Source/AtlantisEons/ZombieCharacter.cpp`: Physics protection system

### **Testing Results**
- ✅ First hit: Works perfectly
- ✅ Subsequent hits: Now working consistently
- ✅ Zombie stability: No more flying zombies
- ✅ Damage numbers: Appearing correctly
- ✅ Combat responsiveness: Immediate enemy facing on attack
- ✅ Animation system: Montages playing with backup timer

**Status**: Combat system is now fully functional and stable. Both player attacks and zombie physics are working as intended.
